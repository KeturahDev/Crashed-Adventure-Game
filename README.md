#### By _**Keturah Howard, Patric Kille **_

## Description

A console thriller game based around finding your missing friend.

You wake up after getting into a crash.. You know your friend was in the car with you when the other car hit, but when you open your eyes and get up from the site, no one else is around. Go around town trying to find them by going to specific locations and talking to those around you. However, be careful- the more times you try to remind people of who your friend is, you begin to lose your memories. Find your friend before amnesia sets in and you lose your friend forever.
